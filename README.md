Protocols
=========

Description of scanning protocols for EEG (ABRs, EFRs), OAEs, head-digitization etc.,
for members of the `Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab <https://engineering.purdue.edu/SNAPLab>`_
at Purdue University.
These are adapted from the protocols
that Hari Bharadwaj and Coralie Pardo created
in the summer of 2014 to run experiments
at the Auditory Neuroscience Lab at Boston University.
