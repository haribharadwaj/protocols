# Acoustic calibrations for hearing research and audiological assessments

## Basic topics

### Calibration of stationary sounds (including pure tones)

- Sound pressure is a *local* quantity (i.e., varies point-to-point in space, and instance-to-instance in time). What is intensity?
- Considerations about coupling sound sources to the ear (free-field, circumaural, supra-aural, inserts), and simulating that situation (to match the *average* human adult or child) on a calibrating instrument (e.g., sound level meter)
- Linearity and distortions of the sound source
- Inter-channel interactions (e.g., left-right separation)
- Calibration of the calibrating instruments using standard sources (e.g., pistonphone), and knowing the microphone frequency response on the calibrating instrument.

### RETSPLs for different source-coupler combinations (i.e., headphones), and what dB HL means

- Standard audiometric headphones + few other RETSPL reports in the literature
- Brief aside on bone oscillators and RETFLs

### Modifications/considerations for the calibration of transient sounds (e.g., clicks, short chirps, tones bursts) and non-stationary sounds (e.g., speech)

- peSPL etc.
- RMS for (longer) speech

### Brief note about nonlinear and time-variant sources and acknowledge that they are beyond the scope of this document

- Hearing aid compression
- Automatic gain control

## Advanced topics

### Wideband immittance and individualized calibrations

- What are standing waves and why we need to account for them (especially for inserts). Aside about warble tones in audiometry. Discussion of "uplift" and RECD.
- Define immittance formally (impedance and admittance, resistance and conductance, absorbance and reflectance; Rosowski et al., 2013)
- Directly measuring pressure using a probe microphone (aka "real-ear" calibrations)
- Define FPL and contrast with incident pressure level
- Considering pressure phase too vs. calibrations of intensity only
- Performing FPL calibrations *in situ* as a substitute for real-ear measurements (Scheperle et al., 2011; Souza et al., 2014 and others) using two-port network theory (Thevenin/Norton).
- Aside about checking for leaks of OAE/immittance probes (Groon et al., paper)
- Define EPL, and note about measuring OAEs in EPL (Charaziak and Shera paper)
- Note about wideband MEMR (Keefe et al., 2017; Bharadwaj et al., 2022)

### Calibration of OAE microphones

- Overall sensitivity and frequency response definitions
- Using probe mic and surrogate "standard" mic in a cylindrical coupler (considerations for sound source high-frequency rolloff (e.g., trim tube)

### Near vs. far-field effects (Mostly pointing to references and acknowledging that addressing them are beyond the scope of this document)

- Wavefronts and divergence
- Evanescent waves (mention Jon Siegel's homegrown beveled tip trick, and Kren's papers)

## Relevant standards

- Just a table, or perhaps skip altogether
- IEC 60645-1:2015, ISO 8523-1:2010, ISO 389, Couplers: IEC 318, 711, 60318-4 etc.
