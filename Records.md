# Overview of paperwork and record-keeping protocols at SNAPlab

When thinking about paperwork it is useful to keep in mind
that there are three buckets under which we detailed documentation:

- Documentation that is IRB protocol-specific ("IRB")
- Documentation that is grant/funding-specific ("grant")
- Documentation that is individual project/study-specific ("project")

In the ideal world, a single grant would fund one or more projects,
with each project having its own IRB.
In practice, however, these buckets overlap.
That is, more than one grant could fund a set of projects, and
the same IRB would cover multiple projects.

At SNAPlab, we have IRB protocols that are organized by
what measurements/procedures they allow,
with the constraint that all measurements for a partcular project
will be covered under a single IRB.
So each subject for any given project will be enrolled via one IRB.

As of this writing, we have three approved IRB protocols:

- Protocol # 1609018209, which is the "main" protocol
- Protocol # IRB-2020-876 for web-only studies (this is technically an approved exemption)
- Protocol # 1904022076, which is our intervention protocol allowing earplug and noise-machine studies.


The intervention protocol requires special training,
and the web-based protocol is such that all thre required records are kept
either by Prolific.co or by snaplabonline.com, so we'll skip both here.
So IRB in the sections below refers to our **"main" protocol.**

Separate from IRB/grant/project level documentation,
we also have the COVID19 documentation and safety procedures,
which are not discussed here.

## IRB 101

All human subject procedures that we do (including recruitment procedures/flyers)
will need to be in the IRB we use. 

Please read the protocol text and consent forms for the protocols you are using.
Referesh often. If you see anything that is odd or could be changed, we can discuss
and amend as needed. They are available on Slack, Z drive (Synology), and Google Drive.

### Mandatory training requirements

All personnel who will work on a study need to be added to the IRB explicitly.

- CITI 
- RCR (Responsible Conduct of Research)

### Technical training

- Informal within our lab. 


## Enrollment and informed consent (IRB-specific)

- Legally needed
- Critical component of IRB protocol

### What to cover when obtaining informed-consent

- Overview of what's going to happen to subject (what is EEG, they'll hear sounds, etc.)
- Remind them that is research and not clinical measurements:
For example, if a subject comes in thinking they have normal hearing, but we find
audiometric elevation, we  can explain that they don't meet our research critera for enrollment,
but also that this is not a clinical diagnosis. We tehn give them referral resources to follow up with
real clinicians.
- Mention risks:
	1. Loud sounds
	2. Skin irritation from contacts
	3. Risk to privacy: We'll collect information like SSN, address, etc. for payment purposes
- How they'll get paid (& how much)
- If they are on a visa.. then extra paperwork needed for payments
	Either SSN (e.g., Purdue employees) -- or -- 
	1. Glacier form
	2. Passport copy
	3. Copy of I-94
	4. Copy of their status form (depend on visa: I-20 for F-visas, DS-2019 for J-visas)

- After signing consent form, have them fill our mandatory form(s).
- Assign a subject ID for the individual on the "SubjectContacts.xls" sheet on Z-drive.
All data are then associated with the subject ID (Sxxx, e.g, S123).

### Mandatory forms and where to store this data

All forms are available on Slack channel for printing. Paper copies will be in the cabinet.

- Consent form: Stored in binder (IRB-specific). Reconsent is always Ok.
- Demographics form: Age, gender, race and ethnicity (Required funding agencies).
Paper copy stored with consent form. Electronically enter this info into our
demographics spreadsheet on google drive (link of Slack).
This will faciliate progress reports for NIH/NSF etc.
- Intro form: Asks about native speaker status, and visa status. This will prompt you
to inform international individuals appropriately.



## Subject payments (Specific to a combination of IRB and Grant)

- Payment forms specify IRB number and funding source, so will be a different one for each combination of
IRB and grant.
- Fill out electronically on the .XLS form, but **do not** save, print instead
- For extra visits, write payment number by hand
- At the end of all visits: Send scanned copy to Emily  via filelocker.
Make sure to sent to the right "Emily".
- Leave paper copy in the cabinet with some annotation (until subject gets paid, which is 6 weeks)
- Keep a record of who has been paid (project-specific, see visit log)

## Visit log (project-specific)

### Calendar logging

### Lab notebook

### Data-collection progress sheets



## Raw data archival (universal)

## Processed data and results archival (project-specific)

### Data sharing for papers
