# Overview of paperwork and record-keeping protocols at SNAPlab

When thinking about paperwork it is useful to keep in mind
that there are three buckets under which we detailed documentation:

- Documentation that is IRB protocol-specific ("IRB")
- Documentation that is grant/funding-specific ("grant")
- Documentation that is individual project/study-specific ("project")

In the ideal world, a single grant would fund one or more projects,
with each project having its own IRB.
In practice, however, these buckets overlap.
That is, more than one grant could fund a set of projects, and
the same IRB would cover multiple projects.

At SNAPlab, we have IRB protocols that are organized by
what measurements/procedures they allow,
with the constraint that all measurements for a partcular project
will be covered under a single IRB.
So each subject for any given project will be enrolled via one IRB.

As of this writing, we have three approved IRB protocols:

- Protocol # 1609018209, which is the "main" protocol
- Protocol # IRB-2020-876 for web-only studies (this is technically an approved exemption)
- Protocol # 1904022076, which is our intervention protocol allowing earplug and noise-machine studies.


The intervention protocol requires special training,
and the web-based protocol is such that all thre required records are kept
either by Prolific.co or by snaplabonline.com, so we'll skip both here.
So IRB in the sections below refers to our **"main" protocol.**

Separate from IRB/grant/project level documentation,
we also have the COVID19 documentation and safety procedures,
which are not discussed here.

## IRB 101

All human subject procedures that we do (including recruitment procedures/flyers)
will need to be in the IRB we use. 

Please read the protocol text and consent forms for the protocols you are using.
Referesh often. If you see anything that is odd or could be changed, we can discuss
and amend as needed. They are available on Slack, Z drive (Synology), and Google Drive.
